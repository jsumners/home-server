# This backend expects to talk to an SSH tunnel. So, on the system hosting the
# app: `ssh 5000:localhost:5000 home-server`.
#
# This is not the way I want to do this. What I want is to host something
# that works like ngrok, but I can't find anything. What I want should:
#
# 1. Not need to deal with certificates in any way. I am terminating TLS with
# HAProxy.
# 2. Support a config file for both the server and the client. At a minimum,
# this would allow for setting an access token.
# 3. The server portion should provide a REST API that the client can use to
# open new tunnels under a new subdomain. I have `*.lt.smurf.pw` so the client
# should be able to ask for `foo.lt.smurf.pw` and the server will oblige.
#
# `boringproxy` comes close. But: 1. it automatically asks for new ACME certs
# for every new tunnel. 2. Tunnels have to be created through a web interface.
# 3. It requires a local OpenSSH server instead of managing the connections
# itself.
#
# I think I'll eventually just have to write it myself if I ever care enough.
# The https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling list links to
# https://github.com/koding/tunnel which seems like it would make writing what
# I require easy-ish, but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
